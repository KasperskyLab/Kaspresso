# Working with adb

In the last lesson, we wrote the first test on Kaspresso, and at this stage, our test can interact with the elements of the application interface, can somehow influence them (approx. click on the button) and check their state (visibility, clickability and etc.).

But often it is not enough to use only the capabilities of our application for testing. For example, during a test, we might want to test the operation of the application in various external states:

<ul>
    <li>When there is no Internet</li>
    <li>During an incoming call</li>
    <li>With a low battery</li>
    <li>When changing device orientation</li>
    <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

In all of the above scenarios, the test must control the device and execute commands that are outside the responsibility of the application we are testing. In these cases, we can use the `Android Debug Bridge` (`ADB`) capabilities.

`ADB` is a command line tool that allows you to interact with your device through various commands. They can help you perform actions such as installing and removing programs, getting a list of installed applications, starting a specific Activity, turning off your Internet connection, and much more.

We can execute all adb commands ourselves through the command line, while the Kaspresso library supports working with adb and can execute them automatically. Adb-server needs to be started so that tests that work with adb can run.

## Check java and adb

The process of launching adb-server is very simple, if the paths to java and adb are correctly registered on your computer. But if the paths are not registered, then they will have to be registered. Therefore, the first thing we will do is check if any additional work is required or if you already have everything ready to start adb-server.

Open a command prompt.

On Windows - the key combination `Win + R`, in the window that opens, enter `cmd` and press `Enter`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/windows_cmd_open_1.png" alt="Open cmd on windows 1"/>

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/windows_cmd_open_2.png" alt="Open cmd on windows 2"/>

First, we check that the path to java is correct. To do this, we write `java -version`.

If everything is fine, then you will see version of installed Java.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/java_version_success.png" alt="Java version showed"/>

If the paths are written incorrectly, you will see something similar to this:

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/java_version_failed.png" alt="Java version failed"/>

Now we do the same check for adb. We print in the console `adb version`.

If everything is fine, then you will see your ADB version.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/adb_version_success.png" alt="Adb version success"/>

Otherwise, you will see something like this error:

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/adb_version_failed.png" alt="Adb version failed"/>

If everything works for you on both points, then you can skip the next step.

## Setting up java and adb

The solution to the problems may differ depending on your operating system and some other factors, so we will present here the most popular solution for OS Windows. If you have a different OS, or for some reason this solution does not help you, then search the Internet for information on how to do the steps below in your situation. Without solving these problems, you will not be able to start adb-server and the tests will not work.

If you have reached this lesson, then you have successfully launched the application from Android Studio on the emulator, which means that java and adb are installed on your computer. The system simply does not know where to look for these programs. What needs to be done is to find the location of these programs and register the paths to them in the system.

We are looking for the path to java, usually it is located in the `jre\bin` folder (in some versions it will be located in `jbr\bin`). It can often be found at `C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0\bin`.

If found - copy this path, if not - open Android Studio. Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Build Tools` -> `Gradle`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/jdk_in_android_studio.png" alt="Show jsdk path in android studio"/>

The path to the desired folder will be written here - copy it.

Now it needs to be registered in the environment variables, for this we click `win + x` -> select `System` -> `Advanced System Settings` -> `Advanced` -> `Environment Variables`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/system_variables.png" alt="Show system variables" />

In the `System Variables` section, select `Path` and click `Edit` -> `New` -> Paste the copied path to the folder with `java` -> Click `OK`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/bin_path.png" alt="Java bin path"/>

Restart the computer for the changes to take effect and check the `java -version` command again.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/java_version_success.png" alt="Java version success"/>

It remains for us to do the same for adb. We are looking for the path to the `platform-tools` folder, which contains `adb`.

Open `Android Studio` -> `Tools` -> `SDK Manager`. The `Android SDK Location` field contains the path to the `Sdk` folder, which contains `platform-tools`.

Copy this path and add it to `System Variables` as we did earlier with `java`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/adb_path.png" alt="Adb path"/>

Restart the computer and check the `adb version` command.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/adb_version_success.png" alt="Adb version success"/>

Now we can start running adb-server. If the `java` and `adb` commands still do not work for you, then google it, there are a lot of options for solving the problem. All you need to do is find the path to java and adb and set them to environment variables.

## Try different commands

Before running the tests, let's see what adb can do, let's look at a few commands.

First, we can see what devices are currently connected to adb. To do this, enter the command `adb devices`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/empty_devices_list.png" alt="Empty devices list"/>

Now we have not connected any device to adb, so the list is empty, let's run the application on the emulator and run the command again.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/devices_list.png" alt="Devices list"/>

Now our emulator is displayed in the list of devices.

With adb commands we can:

<ul>
    <li>Reboot device</li>
    <li>Install some application</li>
    <li>Remove some application</li>
    <li>Upload files from/to a phone</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

For practice, let's remove the tutorial app we just launched. This is done with the command `adb uninstall package_name`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/uninstall_app.png" alt="Uninstall app"/>

The most interesting tasks can be performed by running the `adb shell` command. It invokes the Android console (`shell`) to execute Linux commands on the device.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/open_shell_console.png" alt="Open shell console"/>

Here are some examples of such commands.

Getting a list of all installed applications `pm list packages`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/list_packages.png" alt="List packages"/>

Please note that we first started the shell-console, and then wrote commands, already being in it. Therefore, at the current stage, other adb commands will not work for you until you close the shell console through the exit command.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/exit_shell_console.png" alt="Exit shell console"/>

At the same time, you can execute shell-commands without opening a shell-console, for this it is enough to specify the full name of the command along with `adb shell`. For example, let's try to take a screenshot and save it to the device. In Android Studio, you can open File Explorer, which displays all the files and folders on the device.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/device_file_explorer.png" alt="Device file explorer"/>

Screenshots are usually saved on sdcard, we will do the same.

To create a screenshot, use the `adb shell screencap /{pathToFile}/{name_of_image.png}` command. In our case, it will look like this: `adb shell screencap /sdcard/my_screen.png`.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/create_screenshot.png" alt="Create screenshot"/>

In `Device File Explorer`, right-click and press `Synchronize`, after which the screenshot we created will be displayed in the folder.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/success_screen.png" alt="Success screenshot"/>

## Working with adb in autotests

So, we've had a little practice with adb, now we need to learn how to work with it during the test run. That is, the test that we will create must be able to run adb commands and check the operation of the application after executing these commands.

In order for the tests to be able to execute adb commands, we need to run adb-server on our computer. First you need to download the `adbserver-desktop.jar` file on the official [Kaspresso](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso/blob/master/artifacts/adbserver-desktop.jar) github and run the following command in the terminal:

````
java -jar <path/to/file>/adbserver-desktop.jar
````

In order for the path to the file to be correctly written in the console, it is enough to write the `java -jar ` command and simply drag the `adbserver-desctop.jar` file to the console, the path to the file will be substituted automatically.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/drag_server.png" alt="Drag server"/>

After entering the command, press `Enter`. AdbServer will start. When running the test, the device will tell the desktop the necessary adb commands to run the test.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/launch_server.png" alt="Launch Server"/>

We can start creating an autotest.

Create a new `AdbTest` class in the `com.kaspersky.kaspresso.tutorial` package and inherit from the `TestCase` class.

```kotlin
package com.kaspersky.kaspresso.tutorial

import com.kaspersky.kaspresso.testcases.api.testcase.TestCase

class AdbTest : TestCase() {
}
```

Kaspresso has a special abstraction `AdbServer` for working with adb. An instance of this class is available in `BaseTestContext` and in `BaseTestCase`, of which our `AdbTest` class is a child.

Earlier in the console, we ran the `adb devices` command, which displayed a list of connected devices. Let's run the same command with a test. Create a `test()` method and annotate it with `@Test`.

```kotlin
package com.kaspersky.kaspresso.tutorial

import com.kaspersky.kaspresso.testcases.api.testcase.TestCase
import org.junit.Test

class AdbTest : TestCase() {

    @Test
    fun test() {

    }
}
```

To execute an adb command, we can access the `adbServer` field directly and call one of the methods - `performAdb`, `performCmd` or `performShell`. The names of the methods should make it clear what they do.

<ul>
    <li>`performAdb` execute adb command</li>
    <li>`performShell` executes the shell command</li>
    <li>`performCmd` executes a command line</li>
</ul>

Now we want to call the adb command `devices` call the appropriate method `adbServer.performAdb("devices")`.

```kotlin
package com.kaspersky.kaspresso.tutorial

import com.kaspersky.kaspresso.testcases.api.testcase.TestCase
import org.junit.Test

class AdbTest : TestCase() {

    @Test
    fun test() {
        adbServer.performAdb("devices")
    }
}
```

Run the test. Test completed successfully. Please note that in order to run this test, you must meet 2 conditions:

<ol>
    <li>running adb-server</li>
    <li>the application you are testing must have permission to use the Internet in the manifest</li>
</ol>

We dealt with the first point earlier, now let's deal with the second. Every application that interacts with the Internet must contain permission to use the Internet. It is written in the manifest.

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/manifest_location.png" alt="Manifest Location"/>

If you forget to specify this permission, the test will not work.

Now the test runs the adb command, but does not check the result of its execution. This `adb devices` command returns a list of result strings (type `List<String>`). At the moment, this collection (list of strings) contains only one line like this: `exitCode=0, message=List of devices attached emulator-5555 device`. Let's add a check that the first (and only) element of this collection contains the word "emulator". Just to practice and make sure we get the output of the adb command correctly.

```kotlin
package com.kaspersky.kaspresso.tutorial

import com.kaspersky.kaspresso.testcases.api.testcase.TestCase
import org.junit.Assert // This class needs to be imported
import org.junit.Test

class AdbTest : TestCase() {

    @Test
    fun test() {
        val result = adbServer.performAdb("devices")
        Assert.assertTrue( // Для проверки на то, что какое-то условие выполняется, можно воспользоваться методом Assert.assertTrue(), обратите внимание на импорты
            Assert.assertTrue("emulator" in result.first()) //тут метод in проверяет, что в ответе (первый элемент из списка result) содержит слово "emulator"
        ) 
    }
}
```

Let's launch the test. It passed successfully.

Now let's try to execute a non-existent adb command. First, let's see how its execution looks in the terminal. Let's execute `adb undefined_command`.

!!! info
    Please note that adb-server is currently running in the terminal, if we want to work with the command line while the server is running, we need to launch another terminal window and work in it

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/undefined_command.png" alt="Undefined command"/>

When executing this command inside the test, we will throw an `AdbServerException` exception and the message field will contain a string with the text that we saw in the console `unknown command undefined_command`. To prevent the test from failing, we need to handle this exception in a `try catch` block, and inside the `catch` block, we can add a check that the error message really contains the text specified above.

```kotlin
package com.kaspersky.kaspresso.tutorial

import com.kaspersky.kaspresso.internal.exceptions.AdbServerException
import com.kaspersky.kaspresso.testcases.api.testcase.TestCase
import org.junit.Assert
import org.junit.Test

class AdbTest : TestCase() {

    @Test
    fun test() {
        val result = adbServer.performAdb("devices")
        Assert.assertTrue("emulator" in result.first())

        val command = "undefined_command"
        try {
            adbServer.performAdb(command)
        } catch (e: AdbServerException) {
            Assert.assertTrue("unknown command $command" in e.message)
        }
    }
}
```

Let's launch the test. It passed successfully.

We learned how to run adb commands inside tests. Let's practice adb shell commands. Previously, we got a list of installed applications using a query like `adb shell pm list packages`. Now we will execute it inside the test and check that our application is in the list of installed ones.

```kotlin
val packages = adbServer.performShell("pm list packages")
Assert.assertTrue("com.kaspersky.kaspresso.tutorial" in packages.first())
```

Note that if we call a shell command with `performShell`, then we don't need to write `adb shell`.

Now we have hardcoded the name of the application package, but there is a much more convenient way, inside the tests we can interact with the Device object, get some information about the device, the current application, and much more. From this object, we can get the package name of the current application. To do this, you need to access the `targetContext` property of the `device` object and get `packageName` from the `context`. The test code in this case will change to this:

```kotlin
...
val packages = adbServer.performShell("pm list packages")
Assert.assertTrue(device.targetContext.packageName in packages.first())
...
```

Let's launch the test. It passed successfully.

The last type of commands that we will look at in this lesson are ]cmd commands]. These are the commands that we write in the console. For example, to run an adb command, we write `adb command_name` in the console. Now, if we call `performCmd` instead of `performAdb` in the test, then we will need to write the entire command:

```kotlin
val result = adbServer.performCmd("adb devices")
Assert.assertTrue("emulator" in result.first())
```

In this case, the result of the program will not change.

For practice, we can execute some cmd-command. For example, `hostname` prints the name of the host (your computer). If we run it in the console, the result will be something like this:

<img src="../images/adb_lesson/hostname.png" alt="Hostname"/>

Let's execute the same command inside the test and check that the result is not empty.

```kotlin
val hostname = adbServer.performCmd("hostname")
Assert.assertTrue(hostname.isNotEmpty())
```

Let's launch the test. It passed successfully.

One of the tests we have added checks if there is an emulator in the list of connected devices.

```kotlin
val result = adbServer.performCmd("adb devices")
Assert.assertTrue("emulator" in result.first())
```

We added it just for reference purposes, and to practice with different commands. Real tests can be run both on emulators and on real devices, and tests should not crash because of this, so we will delete this test. The resulting `AdbTest` code will look like this:

```kotlin
package com.kaspersky.kaspresso.tutorial

import com.kaspersky.kaspresso.internal.exceptions.AdbServerException
import com.kaspersky.kaspresso.testcases.api.testcase.TestCase
import org.junit.Assert
import org.junit.Test

class AdbTest : TestCase() {

    @Test
    fun test() {
        val command = "undefined_command"
        try {
            adbServer.performAdb(command)
        } catch (e: AdbServerException) {
            Assert.assertTrue("unknown command $command" in e.message)
        }

        val packages = adbServer.performShell("pm list packages")
        Assert.assertTrue(device.targetContext.packageName in packages.first())

        val hostname = adbServer.performCmd("hostname")
        Assert.assertTrue(hostname.isNotEmpty())
    }
}
```

# Summary

In this lesson, we learned what `adb` is, set up `adb-server` operation, learned how to execute various types of commands (`cmd`, `adb`, `shell`) in the console and in autotests, and also learned about the `Device` object, from which we can receive various information about the device and application we are testing.
