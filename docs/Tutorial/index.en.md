# Introduction

Hi everyone!
<br>If you're here, it means you're interested in Android autotests. Kaspresso is a great solution that can help you. You can find more information about our framework [here](https://kasperskylab.github.io/Kaspresso/).
<br>The Kaspresso team prepared Tutorial in codelabs format. This Tutorial is designed to help you get started with Kaspresso and familiarize yourself with its main features.

## Tutorial structure

The Tutorial is divided into steps (lessons). Each lesson begins with a brief overview and ends with summary and conclusions.

## How to study this Tutorial?

We strive to make the lessons independent from each other, but this is not always possible. For a better understanding of Kaspresso, we recommend starting with the first lesson and moving sequentially to the next.
<br>The codelab format assumes that you will combine theory and practice, repeating the instructions from the lessons step by step. In the Kaspresso project, in the 'tutorial' folder, there is an example of the application code for which tests will be written. The first lesson will tell you how to download it. In the `tutorial_results` branch, you can see the final implementation of all tutorial tests.

## What do you need to know to complete the Tutorial?
We are not trying to teach you autotests from scratch. At the same time, we do not set any restrictions on knowledge and experience for passing the tutorial and try to keep the story in such a way that it is understandable to beginners in autotests and Android. It is almost impossible to talk about Kaspresso without terms from the Java and Kotlin programming languages, the Espresso, Kakao, UiAutomator and other frameworks, the Android operating system and testing itself as an IT area. Nevertheless, the main focus is on the explanation of Kaspresso itself, and in all places where various terms are mentioned, we share links to official sources for detailed information and better understanding.
