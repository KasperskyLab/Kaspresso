# Executing adb commands

## Description
As you remember from the [previous part devoted to Device interface](./05_Device.md), Device interface contains the following things under the hood:
- Espresso
- UI Automator
- ADB

An attentive reader could notice that ADB is not available in Espresso tests. But using some other frameworks, like Appium, you can execute ADB commands. So we decided to add this important functionality too.<br>
We've developed a special Autotest's AdbServer to compensate lack of this feature.
The main idea of the tool is similar to the idea in Appium. We just built a simple client-server system which contains two parts: <br>
- Device that starts up a test acts as client
- Desktop sends ADB commands to be executed on the device.
  Also, the system uses a port forwarding to be able to organize a socket tunnel between Device and Desktop through any kind of connection (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB and etc.).

## Usage
The algorithm how to use Autotest AdbServer:
1. Run the Desktop part on your work station. <br>
   Execute the following command: `java -jar <path/to/kaspresso>/artifacts/adbserver-desktop.jar` in the terminal
2. Run the Device part. <br>
   Build and start [adbserver-sample module](../samples/adbserver-sample). You should see the following screen:
   <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/rt/ia/zqrtiaglx5a1zc4ned-qykl0t_g.png" width="432" height="768"/>

For example, type `shell input text abc` in the app's EditText and click *Execute* button. As result you will get `shell input text abcabc`
in the EditText because ADB command has been executed and `abc` symbols has been added into the focused EditText. <br>
You can notice that the app uses `AdbTerminal` class to execute ADB commands.

## Usage in Kaspresso
In Kaspresso, we wrap `AdbTerminal` into a special interface `AdbServer`.
`AdbServer`'s instance is available in `BaseTestContext` scope and `BaseTestCase` with `adbServer` property: <br>
```kotlin
@Test
fun test() =
    run {
        step("Open Simple Screen") {
            activityTestRule.launchActivity(null)
 ======>    adbServer.performShell("input text 1")   <======

            MainScreen {
                simpleButton {
                    isVisible()
                    click()
                }
            }
        }
        // ....
}
```
Also, don't forget to grant necessary permission:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
``` 

## Options and Logging

### Desktop part
You can also use a few special flags when he starts `adbserver-desktop.jar`. <br>
For example,  `java -jar adbserver-desktop.jar -e emulator-5554,emulator-5556 -p 5041 -l VERBOSE`. <br>
Flags:
- `e`, `--emulators` - the list of emulators that can be captured by `adbserver-desktop.jar` (by default, `adbserver-desktop.jar` captures all available emulators)
- `p`, `--port` - the adb server port number (the default value is 5037)
- `l`, `--logs` - what type of logs show (the default value is INFO).
  For more information, you can run `java -jar adbserver-desktop.jar --help`

Consider available types of logs:
1. ERROR <br>
   You will see only error messages in the output. For example,
```
ERROR 10/09/2020 11:37:19.893  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: Incorrect type of the message...
```
Take a look at the log format. You can see the type of a message, date and time, the host name and the emulator which executes the command, and the message.

2. WARN <br>
   Prints error and warning messages.

3. INFO <br>
   Default value, provides all the base events. For example,
```
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:04.822  desktop=Desktop-25920    message: Desktop started with arguments: emulators=[], adbServerPort=null
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:19.859  desktop=Desktop-25920    message: New device has been found: emulator-5554. Initialize connection to the device...
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:19.892  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The connection establishment to device started
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:19.893  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: WatchdogThread is started from Desktop to Device
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:19.893  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: Desktop tries to connect to the Device.
 It may take time because the device can be not ready. Possible reason: a kaspresso test has not been started
INFO 10/09/2020 11:37:20.185  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The attempt to connect to Device was success
INFO 10/09/2020 11:44:47.810  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The received command to execute: AdbCommand(body=shell input text abc)
INFO 10/09/2020 11:44:49.115  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The executed command: AdbCommand(body=shell input text abc). The result: CommandResult(status=SUCCESS, description=exitCode=0, message=, serviceInfo=The command was executed on desktop=Desktop-25920)
```
Also, the Desktop prints an emulator name, where the concrete command has been executed (this information is available on the Desktop and on the Device).
It could be very useful in debugging. Take a look at the field `serviceInfo` at the end:
```
INFO 10/09/2020 11:44:49.115  desktop=Desktop-25920 device=emulator-5554   message: The executed command: AdbCommand(body=shell input text abc). The result: CommandResult(status=SUCCESS, description=exitCode=0, message=, serviceInfo=The command was executed on desktop=Desktop-25920)
```

4. VERBOSE <br>
   There are cases when you might to debug Desktop part of AdbServer. That's why there is a special very detailed format â€” VERBOSE. <br>
   Have a glance at logs reflecting similar events presented above (initialization, device connection and execution of a command):
```

```
Pay attention that the log row also contains two additional fields: `tag` and `method`. Both fields are autogenerated using `Throwable().stacktrace` method.

5. DEBUG <br>
   Unlike a VERBOSE type, DEBUG packs repeating pieces of logs. For example,
```

``` 

### Device part

In Kaspresso, the `AdbServer` interface has a default implementation `AdbServerImpl`. This implementation sets `WARN` log level for AdbServer.
So, you can see such logs in LogCat: <br>
```
2020-09-10 12:24:27.240 10349-10378/com.kaspersky.kaspressample I/KASPRESSO: ___________________________________________________________________________
2020-09-10 12:24:27.240 10349-10378/com.kaspersky.kaspressample I/KASPRESSO: TEST STEP: "1. Disable network" in DeviceNetworkSampleTest

2020-09-10 12:24:27.240 10349-10378/com.kaspersky.kaspressample W/KASPRESSO_ADBSERVER: Something went wrong (fake message)
```
All the logs are printed with `KASPRESSO_ADBSERVER` tag with `WARN` log level. <br>
If you want to debug the Device part of Autotest AdbServer (the device part), you can set `VERBOSE` log level:
```kotlin
class DeviceNetworkSampleTest : TestCase(
    kaspressoBuilder = Kaspresso.Builder.simple {
        libLogger = UiTestLoggerImpl(Kaspresso.DEFAULT_LIB_LOGGER_TAG)
        adbServer = AdbServerImpl(LogLevel.VERBOSE, libLogger)
    }
) {...}
```
Now the logs looks like:
```

```

## Development
The source code of AdbServer is available in [adb-server](../adb-server) module. <br>
If you want to build `adbserver-desktop.jar` manually, just execute `./gradlew :adb-server:adbserver-desktop:assemble`.
