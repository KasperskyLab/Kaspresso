/**
 * This is a comfortable wrapper to work with AdbServer repository.
 * Important notes:
 * 1. Real connection is established only after a call one of methods of the interface except disconnectServer().
 * So it's lazy wrapper. Keep it in your mind when you decide to put custom implementation od AdbServer.
 * 2. After each test a developer has to disconnect AdbServer. There is disconnectServer() method to complete the disconnection.
 * But Kaspresso calls disconnectServer() after each test if the connection was established during the test. What's why don't worry =)
