/**
 * The implementation of [ObjectBehaviorInterceptor] and [FailureLoggingProvider] interfaces.
 * Provides failure logging functionality for [UiObjectInteraction.perform] and [UiObjectInteraction.check] calls.
 *
 * Important!
 * By default, the interceptor is not used in Kaspresso because this one pollutes logs by error messages that may confuse a user.
 * If you desire to change result log (especially in case of an error) we recommend to use [FailureLoggingProvider] directly.
